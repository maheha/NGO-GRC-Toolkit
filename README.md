NGO GRC ToolkitA free, browser-based tool to help NGOs build an ISO 27001 Risk Register and a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA).About This ProjectThe NGO GRC Toolkit is a guided, step-by-step application designed to simplify the complex but crucial process of risk management for Non-Governmental Organizations. Many NGOs handle highly sensitive data but may not have the resources for expensive Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) software. This tool bridges that gap by providing a simple, effective, and completely free solution.Most importantly, your privacy is paramount. This tool runs entirely in your web browser. No data is ever sent to a server, and no cookies are used. Your information remains on your computer at all times.Key FeaturesGuided 4-Step Process: A simple wizard that walks you through creating your GRC documentation.ISO 27001 Risk Register: Identify assets, define risks, and map them to the official ISO 27001:2022 Annex A controls.DPIA Questionnaire: A straightforward Data Protection Impact Assessment to help you comply with privacy regulations like GDPR.Session Management: Save your progress to a local file at any time and load it back up to continue your work.Data Export: Download your complete GRC report as a professional PDF or your risk register data as a CSV file for use in other programs.CSV Import: Already have a list of risks? Import them directly from a CSV file to get started quickly.Duplicate Finder: A handy utility to scan your risk register for potential duplicate entries.Getting Started (For All Users)Using the toolkit is simple. You just need a modern web browser and an internet connection.Navigate to the Releases Page (link to be updated).Download the toolkit.html file from the latest release.Open the downloaded toolkit.html file in your web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge).Note: An active internet connection is required because the tool loads its styling (Tailwind CSS) and PDF generation libraries from a secure Content Delivery Network (CDN). This keeps the file size small and ensures you're always using an up-to-date version of those libraries.For Developers (Technical Details)This project is intentionally built as a "vanilla" single-page application to ensure maximum portability and simplicity.Tech StackHTML5: For the core structure.Tailwind CSS: For all styling, loaded via CDN.JavaScript (ES6+): All application logic is contained within a single <script> tag. There are no external frameworks or libraries, keeping it lightweight and easy to understand.jsPDF & jsPDF-AutoTable: Used for the PDF export functionality, loaded via CDN.Project StructureThe entire application is contained within a single toolkit.html file. This was a deliberate design choice to make it incredibly easy for non-technical users to download and run without needing a web server or complex setup.ContributingContributions are welcome!
