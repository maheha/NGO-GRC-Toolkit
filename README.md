## About This Project

The NGO GRC Toolkit is a guided, step-by-step application designed to simplify the complex but crucial process of risk management for Non-Governmental Organizations. Many NGOs handle highly sensitive data but may not have the resources for expensive Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) software. This tool bridges that gap by providing a simple, effective, and completely free solution.

**Most importantly, your privacy is paramount.** This tool runs entirely in your web browser. No data is ever sent to a server, and no cookies are used. Your information remains on your computer at all times.
